# Start a new website project locally

## Setting up the repository

Go to the directory where you keep your projects, and initialize the git source control repository


    $ mkdir start-locally
	# Create a new directory for the project

	$ cd start-locally	

	$ git init

It is best practive to create a README.md file, .gitignore file, and LICENSE.md

    $ echo "New website project - started locally" >README.md
	# Create a README file

	$ git commit -a -m"Create a README file"
